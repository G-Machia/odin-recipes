    <h1>Homemade Lasagna Noodles</h1>
    <p>Homemade lasagna noodles are easier to make than you think and you don't even need a pasta machine. And forget about blanching the sheets before baking — no precooking is required!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ¼ cups Italian-style tipo 00 flour, plus additional for dusting</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
            <p><b>Step 1</b></p>
                <p>Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface. Make a well in the center and crack in eggs; add salt. Gently beat eggs using a fork, incorporating surrounding flour, until mixture is runny. Bring remaining flour into the mixture using a bench scraper until dough forms a ball. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if dough feels too stiff.</p>

            <p><b>Step 2</b></p>
                <p>Knead dough with your hands by flattening, stretching it, and folding the top towards the center. Turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is soft and smooth, about 10 minutes.</p>

            <p><b>Step 3</b></p>
                <p>Shape dough into a ball. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm, 30 minutes to 1 hour</p>

            <hr></hr>

            <p><b>Step 4</b></p>
                <p>Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Take one piece and flatten it a bit with your hands. Dust a work surface with flour and roll dough out using a rolling pin 5 to 6 times. Turn dough 45 degrees and roll out again, 5 to 6 times. Keep rolling and turning in the same way until dough is evenly very thin. When you hold up the dough, you should be able to see your fingers through it.</p>

            <p><b>Step 5</b></p>
                <p>Cut pasta dough into rectangular sheets to fit your baking dish using a pastry wheel or a knife. Transfer lasagna sheets to a floured kitchen towel and let air-dry for about 30 minutes before assembling.</p>

        <h2>Pasta Machine Option:</h2>
            <p>Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Flatten 1 portion and pass through the thickest setting of the machine. Dust with flour, fold in half like a book, and repeat 3 to 4 times — always flouring, folding, and passing through the thickest setting — until dough is smooth in texture, even in size, and no longer sticky. Set the machine to a middle setting and pass each sheet through once more. Move to the next-to-last setting and pass through again. Cut 1 long strip in half. Pass the first half through the thinnest setting. Place this very long and thin sheet on a floured cloth. Repeat with remaining dough to make 6 long sheets. Trim sheets to fit your baking dish. Air-dry for 30 minutes, assemble, and bake.</p>
